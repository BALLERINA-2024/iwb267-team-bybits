# ✨ BeautyZone ✨

Welcome to  BeautyZone, an app that blends beauty, fashion, and technology! 💅🛍️ Built with a React Native frontend and powered by a Ballerina backend, this project is designed to deliver a seamless experience for users. Let's get you up and running!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🖥️💻 Full Project Setup (Backend + Frontend)

1. Backend Setup (Ballerina):
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory twice:
     ```bash
     cd backend/backend
     ```
   - Run the backend with:
     ```bash
     bal run
     ```
     This will also connect to your MongoDB with the relevant URL configured. 🎯

2. Frontend Setup (React Native):
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend/glamhub
     ```
   - To launch the app in an Android emulator, run:
     ```bash
     npm run android
     ```
   - Watch as the emulator spins up, and voilà, your frontend is live! 🎨

### 🛠️ Development Tips

- Make sure to run frontend and backend in separate terminals! 🖥️ ➕ 📱
- MongoDB must be set up and accessible for the backend to function correctly. 🌐💾
- Ensure your Android emulator is up and running before launching the frontend! 📱

Happy coding! 🎉💻
